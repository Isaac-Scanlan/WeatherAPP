## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/WeatherApp.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd WeatherApp
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

4. Build and run the project:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

## Installation on Windows
Follow these steps to set up and run **WeatherApp** on a Windows machine:

1. **Ensure .NET Core SDK is Installed**:
   - If you don‚Äôt have the .NET Core SDK installed, you can download it from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).
   - Once installed, verify by running the following command in your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell):
     ```bash
     dotnet --version
     ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/username/WeatherApp.git
     cd WeatherApp
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - In the project directory, restore the necessary packages:
     ```bash
     dotnet restore
     ```

4. **Build the Application**:
   - To compile the application, run:
     ```bash
     dotnet build
     ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   - After building, you can run the app with the following command:
     ```bash
     dotnet run
     ```

6. **Create an Executable** (Optional):
   - If you want to create a standalone executable for Windows, you can publish the project using:
     ```bash
     dotnet publish -c Release -r win10-x64 --self-contained
     ```
   - This will generate an executable in the `bin/Release/netcoreappX.X/win10-x64/publish/` directory (replace `X.X` with your .NET Core version).

7. **Run the Published Executable**:
   - Navigate to the `publish` folder and run the generated `.exe` file to start the application without needing to install .NET Core SDK.

## Usage
After the application starts, you can:
- **Search** for weather by entering a city name in the search bar.
- **View detailed forecasts** including temperature, humidity, and wind speed for the current day.

## Technologies Used
- **C#**: Core programming language for the application.
- **.NET Core**: For building the desktop application.
- **WPF**: Used to create the user interface and manage the UX.
- **MVVM**: Architectural pattern to ensure a clean separation of logic.
- **API Integration**: Uses external APIs to fetch real-time weather data.
- **XUnit**: For writing and running unit tests to ensure the app functions as expected.

## Testing
This project has comprehensive test coverage written in XUnit. To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
dotnet test
